# visualization-tool-for-cnn
Multiple visualization tools for convolutional neural networks.

Visualization of intermediate activations & convnet filters (`activation&convfilter_visualization.ipynb`) and class activation heatmaps (`class_activation.ipynb`). The algorithms are similar to those provided by [Deep
Learning with Python](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks), yet with different implementation. Here I implemented the algorithms using `GradientTape` via TensorFlow Eager execution, instead of `keras.backend`.
